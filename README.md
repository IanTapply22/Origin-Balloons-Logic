# Running/Compiling
Either [create an intellij run/debug configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) or run the following command in your project with the latest [processing](https://processing.org/download)
downloaded.<br>

``` shell
$ javac -cp "path\to\processing\core.jar" Main.java
```

# TODO/Planned

- ~~More configurations for segments.~~
- Debug options.
- ~~Indications for indexes. (last & first segments)~~
